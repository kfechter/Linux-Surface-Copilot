# I returned the Surface
it was a nice device, and I hope for great linux support on the platform, but it was just another computer I didn't need.


# Linux-Surface-Copilot
Repo to track linux testing on surface pro 11th edition


# Goal
Test linux on the new Snapdragon X Elite powered Surface

# Qualcomm Disclaimer for Qualcomm debian image
Note that the installer works only on our reference device. We hope to work closely with OEMs and distro vendors soon to create similar, easy-to-use installers for commercially available devices powered by the Snapdragon X Elite.
