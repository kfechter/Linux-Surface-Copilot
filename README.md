# Linux-Surface-Copilot
Repo to track linux testing on surface Laptop 7th edition


# Goal
Test linux on the new Snapdragon X Elite powered Surface Laptop

Note that the installer works only on our reference device. We hope to work closely with OEMs and distro vendors soon to create similar, easy-to-use installers for commercially available devices powered by the Snapdragon X Elite.
